<p>Hello, I am Eduardo Wanderley, a 31-year-old professional with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at UFPE. In 2023, I completed my postgraduate studies, also at UFPE, in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Software Testing, reflecting my passion for cutting-edge technologies.</p>

<p>Since a young age, I have had a passion for technology, innovation, and learning. Throughout my academic career, I delved into frontend development, primarily using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tkinter.</p>

<p>At present, my main focus is on web development and mobile app creation, utilizing technologies such as Python, Typescript, React, Redux, GraphQL, Flutter, and Swift, as I believe these platforms pave the way for innovative user experiences.</p>

<p>One of the most significant projects I worked on in the frontend domain was creating software that controlled a robotic arm in Flutter, allowing users to manipulate the arm for sorting medications. This provided an intuitive and efficient experience in planning the daily activities of a hospital.</p>

<p>Beyond frontend development, I immersed myself in the realm of educational robotics, actively participating in robotics projects in public schools. This experience fueled my interest in the potential of technology to revolutionize education.</p>

<p>Currently, I am focused on exploring new technologies and frameworks for frontend development, seeking to enhance my technical and interpersonal skills, while concurrently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering.</p>

<p>In addition to my professional endeavors, I am a music enthusiast. I have been playing the guitar since I was 12 and am a devoted fan of The Beatles, David Bowie, and David Gilmour. My musical journey includes involvement in approximately 5 bands.Hello, I am Eduardo Wanderley, a 31-year-old professional with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering.
