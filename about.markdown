Hello, I am Eduardo Wanderley, a 31-year-old professional with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at UFPE. In 2023, I completed my postgraduate studies, also at UFPE, in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Software Testing, reflecting my passion for cutting-edge technologies.

Since a young age, I have had a passion for technology, innovation, and learning. Throughout my academic career, I delved into frontend development, primarily using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tkinter.

At present, my main focus is on web development and mobile app creation, utilizing technologies such as Python, Typescript, React, Redux, GraphQL, Flutter, and Swift, as I believe these platforms pave the way for innovative user experiences.

One of the most significant projects I worked on in the frontend domain was creating software that controlled a robotic arm in Flutter, allowing users to manipulate the arm for sorting medications. This provided an intuitive and efficient experience in planning the daily activities of a hospital.

Beyond frontend development, I immersed myself in the realm of educational robotics, actively participating in robotics projects in public schools. This experience fueled my interest in the potential of technology to revolutionize education.

Currently, I am focused on exploring new technologies and frameworks for frontend development, seeking to enhance my technical and interpersonal skills, while concurrently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I am a music enthusiast. I have been playing the guitar since I was 12 and am a devoted fan of The Beatles, David Bowie, and David Gilmour. My musical journey includes involvement in approximately 5 bands.Hello, I am Eduardo Wanderley, a 31-year-old professional with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering.
