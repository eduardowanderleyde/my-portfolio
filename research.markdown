I make an Reaserch on Detection and manipulation of collection tubes using Kinova GenLite robotic arm.

The Reaserch involves procedures for image collection, dataset planning, neural network training, image processing algorithm adaptation, workspace setup for Kinova manipulation, and performance optimization.
